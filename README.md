# Product Review Analysis Website


## Introduction

The **Product Review Analysis** project is a web application built using Flask, designed to perform sentiment analysis on user-generated product reviews. It utilizes the TextBlob library to analyze the textual content of reviews and provide users with a sentiment score on a scale of 1 to 5, helping them gauge the overall sentiment of a product or service based on aggregated user feedback.

This README file will guide you through setting up and running the project on your local machine.
